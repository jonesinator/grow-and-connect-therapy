          Breastfeeding is good for babies and moms. Infants that are breastfed
          get antibodies from their mothers against common illnesses. Breastfed
          babies have less chance of being obese as an adult. Breastfeeding a
          baby lets the infant-mother pair bond in a very unique way. Motherâ€™s
          who breastfeed lower their chances of developing breast cancer.
          Usually, mothers who breastfeed lose their pregnancy weight more
          quickly and easily. The benefits of breastfeeding are numerous.

          entire week. She had her eyes on him for months, and it had taken a
          convoluted scheme with several friends to make it happen, but he'd
          finally taken the hint and asked her out. After all the time and
          effort she'd invested into it, she never thought that it would be

          Green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves
          toward the top of the canopy. Ants used the vine as their private
          highway, avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark, to freely
          move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on
          their current chore. At least this was the way it was supposed to be.
          Something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a
          gap in the once pristine ant highway.

          It was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers
          over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your
          bed. You want to look, but you don't at the same time. You're frozen
          with fear and unable to act. That's where she found herself and she
          didn't know what to do next

          My pincher collar is snapped on. Then comes the electric zapper
          collar. Finally, my purple at-home collar is taken off and I know Iâ€™m
          going for a walk to the dog park. Iâ€™m so excited to see my friends. I
          hope Spike or Thunder are there already. They're the most fun to chase
          and tumble with. My human is pretty strict with me. Iâ€™m only allowed
          on the grass and not on the sidewalks. I think sheâ€™s afraid Iâ€™m going
          to jump on the other humans. I donâ€™t understand why everyone else gets
          to jump on the benches and run wild on the sidewalks. They donâ€™t
          listen to their humans. I know I could ignore mine but if I do she may
          zap me and itâ€™s just not worth it. She probably wouldnâ€™t let me back
          at the dog park if I didnâ€™t listen to her. I just love the dog park.

          All he could think about was how it would all end. There was still a
          bit of uncertainty in the equation, but the basics were there for
          anyone to see. No matter how much he tried to see the positive, it
          wasn't anywhere to be seen. The end was coming and it wasn't going to
          be pretty.
